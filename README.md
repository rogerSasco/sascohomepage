Of course. This is an excellent question. The `policy.json` file you have is an *export* of policies that are applied to a device. To change the behavior for all your organization's devices, you need to push these updated policies from a central management console.

You have two primary methods to do this, and the recommended modern approach is through **Microsoft Intune**, which is part of Microsoft 365.

### Method 1: Recommended Method - Using Microsoft Intune

Microsoft Intune is the cloud-based endpoint management tool within Microsoft Endpoint Manager. It's the standard way to manage policies for Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android devices in a modern workplace.

**Step-by-Step Guide for Intune:**

1.  **Access the Admin Centers:**
    *   Go to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://endpoint.microsoft.com/).
    *   Alternatively, go to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/) and navigate to **All admin centers** > **Intune**.

2.  **Create a Configuration Profile:**
    *   In the Intune admin center, go to **Devices** > **Configuration profiles** > **Create profile**.
    *   **Platform:** Select **Windows 10 and later**.
    *   **Profile type:** Select **Templates** and then choose **Settings catalog** from the dropdown. This is the most flexible and modern way to configure policies.

3.  **Configure the Profile:**
    *   **Name:** Give your profile a descriptive name, e.g., "Microsoft Edge - Corporate Homepage Policy".
    *   **Description:** (Optional) Add a description.
    *   Click **Next**.

4.  **Add Settings:**
    *   Click **Add settings**. This will open a settings picker.
    *   In the search bar, type "HomepageLocation". You will see the result under **Microsoft Edge** > **Startup, home page and new tab page**.
    *   Select the checkbox next to **Configure the home page URL**.
    *   The setting will now appear in your configuration list. Click on it to expand.
    *   Set **Configure the home page URL** to **Enabled**.
    *   In the **Home page URL** field, paste your URL: `https://sascosg.sharepoint.com/sites/SASCOSeniorCitizens'Home`
    *   **Important:** Because your URL contains an apostrophe (`'`), you must **URI-encode** it to avoid JSON errors. The encoded version is:
        `https://sascosg.sharepoint.com/sites/SASCOSeniorCitizens%27Home`
        (You can use a free online tool to encode URLs if needed). **Use this encoded version to be safe.**
    *   **Also Add These Recommended Settings:**
        *   Search for and add **RestoreOnStartup** (under *Microsoft Edge > Startup, home page and new tab page*).
            *   Set to **Enabled**.
            *   Set **Action on startup** to **Open the New Tab page**. (This is the integer value `4` from your JSON).
        *   Search for and add **HomepageIsNewTabPage** (under the same category).
            *   Set to **Enabled**.
            *   Set **Use the New Tab page as the home page** to **Disabled**.

5.  **Assign the Profile:**
    *   Click **Next** to go to the **Scope tags** page (you can skip this if you don't use them).
    *   Click **Next** to go to the **Assignments** page.
    *   Choose which groups of users or devices to assign this policy to. To apply to all devices, assign it to a group containing all devices (e.g., `All Devices` or a specific security group you create). **Assigning to a device group is often more reliable for machine-wide settings.**
    *   Click **Next**.

6.  **Review and Create:**
    *   Review your settings on the final page and click **Create**.

The policy will now be deployed to the devices in the assigned group. It can take some time (up to several hours) for devices to check in and receive the new policy.

### Method 2: Legacy Method - Using Group Policy (ADMX) in Azure AD

This method is less common for cloud-only devices but is possible if you are using Azure Active Directory (Azure Entra ID) joined devices and have access to upload custom ADMX templates. It's generally more complex than using Intune.

1.  **Access the Portal:**
    *   Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
    *   Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **Groups**.

2.  **Create a Security Group:**
    *   Create a new security group (e.g., "Edge Homepage Policy") and add all the users or devices you want to target.

3.  **Use the Group Policy Blade (Preview):**
    *   In the Azure AD blade, search for or find **Group Policy** under the "Monitoring & health" section. This is a preview feature that allows you to create cloud-based Group Policy Objects (GPOs).
    *   Create a new policy and assign it to the security group you just created.

4.  **Configure the Policy:**
    *   You would need to ensure the Microsoft Edge ADMX templates are ingested. You would then navigate to the same policy paths:
        *   Computer Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates > Microsoft Edge > **Startup, home page and new tab page**
    *   Enable and configure:
        *   **Configure the home page URL**
        *   **Action to take on startup** (set to "Open the New Tab page")
        *   **Configure the Home button to show the New Tab page** (set to disabled)

### Summary and Recommendation

| Method | Pros | Cons | Best For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Microsoft Intune** | **Modern, cloud-native, easier UI, detailed reporting.** | Requires Intune licenses (included in most M365 business plans). | **This is the recommended and most straightforward method.** |
| **Azure AD Group Policy** | Good for organizations familiar with traditional GPO. | Feature is in preview, less intuitive than Intune, less reporting. | Organizations heavily invested in the Group Policy paradigm migrating to the cloud. |

**Your next step should be to use Method 1 (Microsoft Intune).** The policy settings you need to add in the Intune Settings Catalog directly correspond to the ones I added to your `policy.json` file.

**Final Important Note:** Remember to use the URL-encoded version of your homepage (`...Citizens%27Home`) in the Intune policy field to ensure it applies correctly.
